# Kvlt Bot
A Trve Bvlt bot that turns 'normal' 'boring' text into the köölest blackest
metalest text! This bot repeats whatever your write translated into Trve Kvlt.
If the constant repeated messages annoy you than you have to write the 'correct'
way first.

# What is Trve Kvlt?
If your confused to what Trve Kvlt means your not the only one. It basically
means underground Norwegian black metal culture but has been parodied so much
that is has become a meme.

# Inspiration
This bot was heavily inspired by stupid jokes with my buddy Felix and the
hilarious guys over at
[Pagefire](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gD8kk_Z_5bX2PcRk2fwDg).
